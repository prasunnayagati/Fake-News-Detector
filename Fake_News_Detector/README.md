# AETHER | Neural Truth Sentinel 🛰️

**Aether** is a state-of-the-art Neural Truth Sentinel designed for deep-layer linguistic analysis and synthetic disinformation detection. Built on high-performance scikit-learn engines and powered by **Explainable AI (XAI)**, Aether provides forensic insights into how and why news is classified as authentic or anomalous.

## 🌌 Core Features
- **Neural Scan Engine:** Real-time semantic analysis using optimized Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectors.
- **Deep Feature Activation:** Integrating **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to visualize neural decision pathways.
- **Global Archive Matcher:** Cross-referencing inputs against a 44,000+ record forensic news archive for semantic overlaps.
- **Linguistic Audit Agent:** AI-driven pattern recognition for sensationalism, urgency markers, and speculative tones.
- **Ultra-Premium UI:** A cinema-grade dark mode experience with glassmorphism and real-time response metrics.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide
1. **Initialize Environment:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Data Synchronization:**
   - Source the [Kaggle Fake & Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).
   - Deposit `True.csv` and `Fake.csv` into `data/raw/`.
3. **Trigger Training Sequence:**
   Run `python train.py` to calibrate the neural weights.
4. **Launch Sentinel Interface:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🔬 Scientific Architecture
Aether is built for research-grade interpretability. By analyzing the coefficients of the underlying linear model through the lens of additive feature attribution (SHAP), we bridge the gap between "Black Box" predictions and human-readable forensic reports.

### Advanced Research Directions
- **Cross-Domain Entropy:** Analyzing how semantic patterns evolve across different news categories (e.g., Politics vs. Science).
- **Adversarial Robustness:** Testing the sentinel against "synthetic noise" and intentional linguistic obfuscation.
- **Human-AI Synergy:** Measuring the cognitive impact of explainable visual exports on user verification accuracy.
